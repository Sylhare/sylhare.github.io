Some tips, software and shortcut that are useful with mac. 
Mostly oriented for developers 101.

## Shortcuts

- <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>space</kbd> For emojis 😉💪🏝🙆‍️
- Delete a folder and file with <kbd>delete</kbd> instead of move to trash
- <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>.</kbd> for showing hidden files
- <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>space</kbd> for language switching  🇺🇸 - 🇱🇨
- <kbd>fn</kbd> + <kbd>f11</kbd> to see the desktop background
- <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>←</kbd> or <kbd>→</kbd> to go to the different desktops
- <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>↓</kbd> to choose which window in the desktop

## Screenshot

The image will be saved on the desktop:

- <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>3</kbd> For a full screenshots
- <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>4</kbd> To select what to screenshots within the screen

To copy the screenshot (not creating a file), hold the <kbd>ctrl</kbd> button while doing the above. 

## Change your name

Change your name on Mac:

```bash
sudo scutil --set ComputerName "newname"
sudo scutil --set LocalHostName "newname"
sudo scutil --set HostName "newname"
```

## Enable accents on key hold

Usually you can do that by holding the letter and the accent should appear, however after some updates, it can disable
itself. Quirky 🤓

To re-enable it, make sure you have a keyboard with accent set in your keyboard settings and run:

```bash
defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool true
```

Then restart the computer, and the feature should be back.
If it's still not back, then check with the keyboard settings (restoring defaults, keyboard repeat speed) to fine tune
it.

## Customize your terminal

Using [`Iterm2`]2 for terminal and some [customization][1]
detailed in this article, you could make your terminal look fancier!

{% include aligner.html images="iterm2-agnoster.png" column=1 %}

With the Z shell aka `zsh` and a theme from [Oh My Zsh][1] to add some icons and colours. 

## Other tools

- [`Spectacle`][3] for screen splitting (not actively maintain anymore)
- [`Fork`][4] for version control (not free anymore)
